## 1. Neural Network Approach (Semantic Feature Engineering)

### Architecture Overview

The neural network approach revolutionized our strategy by moving from raw CBOR bytes to engineered semantic features, addressing the fundamental limitation that CNNs couldn't capture semantic patterns from binary data.

#### Network Architecture

The neural network uses a simple feedforward architecture implemented in PyTorch. The network takes 64 semantic features as input (32 features extracted from each CBOR payload, then concatenated for comparison). 

**Architecture Design:**
- **Input Layer**: 64 semantic features representing both payloads
- **Hidden Layers**: Three progressively smaller layers (128 ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 32 neurons)
- **Output Layer**: Single neuron with sigmoid activation for similarity probability
- **Total Parameters**: 19,137 parameters (much smaller than previous CNN approaches)
- **Regularization**: 30% dropout between layers to prevent overfitting
- **Normalization**: Batch normalization after each linear layer for stable training

### Semantic Feature Engineering

The breakthrough came from extracting 32 carefully designed semantic features from each CBOR payload:

#### Feature Categories

The 32 semantic features are organized into five distinct categories:

**1. Structural Features (4 features)**
Basic payload characteristics including total length, unique byte count, first byte (indicating CBOR major type), and last byte patterns.

**2. CBOR-Specific Patterns (8 features)**
Distribution of CBOR major types throughout the payload. CBOR uses 3-bit major types to indicate data categories: unsigned integers, negative integers, byte strings, text strings, arrays, maps, tags, and simple values. These features capture the relative frequency of each type.

**3. Statistical Features (4 features)**
Statistical properties of the byte values including normalized mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values across the payload.

**4. IoT Pattern Detection (10 features)**
Detection of common byte patterns that frequently appear in IoT and RDF communications, including CBOR tag indicators, text string markers, map/array delimiters, and boolean/null value encodings.

**5. Semantic Structure Hints (6 features)**
Higher-level content analysis including numeric value density, ASCII text density, binary data density, entropy measures, and repetition patterns that indicate structured vs random data.

### Training Strategy

The neural network uses a specialized Weighted Focal Loss function designed to handle class imbalance while focusing learning on difficult examples. This loss function combines three key techniques: focal weighting (gamma=2.0) to emphasize hard examples, class balancing (alpha=0.75) to account for the 80% negative class bias, and positive weighting (pos_weight=2.0) to boost positive example learning.

**Training Configuration:**
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001 and weight decay 0.01 for regularization
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Automatic reduction when validation performance plateaus
- **Training Duration**: 15 epochs maximum with early stopping to prevent overfitting
- **Batch Processing**: 32 samples per batch for stable gradient computation
- **Data Distribution**: 80% negative pairs, 20% positive pairs reflecting real-world imbalance

### Performance Analysis

#### Test Dataset Results (80% Negatives)

Testing on the challenging dataset with 80% negative samples, the neural network achieved an F1-score of 82.3% with 69.9% precision and perfect 100% recall. However, specificity remained low at 43.6%, indicating difficulty distinguishing true negatives. The confusion matrix showed 51 true positives, 22 false positives, 17 true negatives, and 0 false negatives. Training completed in just 2.3 seconds.

#### Balanced Dataset Results (50% Negatives)

On the balanced dataset, performance improved slightly with an F1-score of 84.0%, precision of 73.5%, and recall of 98.0%. Specificity increased to 64.1%, showing better negative detection with balanced data.

#### Strengths
- ‚úÖ **High Recall**: Perfect 100% recall ensures no missed matches
- ‚úÖ **Fast Training**: Only 2.3 seconds training time
- ‚úÖ **Semantic Understanding**: Features capture actual semantic patterns
- ‚úÖ **Significant Improvement**: 82.3% vs 66.0% baseline F1-score

#### Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low Specificity**: 43.6% means many false positives
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Concerns**: High false positive rate problematic for production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature Engineering Dependent**: Requires manual feature design

#### Model Export Capabilities

The neural network can be exported to ONNX format for deployment in production IoT environments. The exported model accepts 64 semantic features as input and outputs a single similarity score between 0 and 1. With only 19,137 parameters, the model is lightweight and suitable for resource-constrained devices.

---

## 2. Random Forest Approach (Semantic Features)

### Architecture Overview

The Random Forest approach used the same 32 semantic features but with a traditional machine learning classifier, providing interpretability and stability.

#### Model Configuration

The Random Forest classifier was optimized through systematic grid search to find the best hyperparameters. The final configuration uses 100 decision trees with a maximum depth of 10 levels each. Class weighting is set to "balanced" to automatically handle the 80% negative sample imbalance. The model requires minimum 2 samples for splitting nodes and minimum 2 samples per leaf, preventing overfitting while maintaining decision granularity. All 64 concatenated semantic features are used without feature selection.

### Feature Importance Analysis

The Random Forest revealed which semantic features were most discriminative for similarity detection. The top features include CBOR major type distribution patterns, payload length characteristics, last byte patterns, and IoT-specific pattern detection. Entropy measures and statistical features also ranked highly, while semantic structure hints and pattern detection features provided additional discriminative power. This analysis showed that structural CBOR features were more important than content-based features for this dataset.

### Training Process

The Random Forest underwent comprehensive hyperparameter optimization using grid search across multiple dimensions. The search explored different numbers of trees (100, 200, 300), maximum tree depths (10, 15, 20, unlimited), minimum samples for node splitting (2, 5, 10), minimum samples per leaf (1, 2, 4), and class weighting strategies (balanced vs unweighted). The optimization used 3-fold cross-validation with F1-score as the target metric to ensure balanced performance across precision and recall.

### Performance Analysis

#### Test Dataset Results (80% Negatives)

The Random Forest achieved strong balanced performance on the challenging 80% negative dataset. With an F1-score of 78.4%, it demonstrated 73.1% precision and 84.4% recall. Most importantly, it achieved excellent specificity of 92.2%, correctly identifying 166 true negatives while only misclassifying 14 as false positives. The model captured 38 true positives with only 7 false negatives. Training required 98.1 seconds, significantly longer than the neural network but still reasonable for the comprehensive grid search optimization.

#### Strengths
- ‚úÖ **Excellent Specificity**: 92.2% minimizes false positives
- ‚úÖ **Balanced Performance**: Good precision-recall balance
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: High precision suitable for deployment
- ‚úÖ **Interpretable**: Feature importance analysis available
- ‚úÖ **Stable**: Consistent performance across runs

#### Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Slower Training**: 98.1 seconds vs 2.3 seconds for NN
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lower F1**: 78.4% vs 82.3% for Neural Network
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature Dependent**: Still requires manual feature engineering

#### Model Persistence

The optimized Random Forest model is saved in pickle format for immediate production deployment, ensuring consistent performance and eliminating the need for retraining.

## 3. Transformer Approach (Structural CBOR Decoding)

### Architecture Overview

The transformer approach represented a paradigm shift: instead of manual feature engineering, it used proper CBOR structural decoding combined with pre-trained language models to achieve **structural and content similarity detection**. Note: This approach works with encoded CBOR payloads without requiring semantic ontology terms.

#### Core Innovation: Structural CBOR Decoding

The transformer approach fundamentally differs from previous methods by leveraging CBOR's self-describing structure. Instead of processing raw bytes, it first decodes the CBOR payload using the standard cbor2 library to extract the actual data structure. The decoder identifies text elements, numeric values, structural organization, and data types within the CBOR format. When full decoding fails due to malformed data, a fallback mechanism extracts readable text patterns from the raw bytes. This structural approach preserves the semantic relationships encoded within the CBOR format rather than treating it as opaque binary data.


#### Structural Text Creation

After extracting content from the CBOR structure, the system creates a standardized text representation for the transformer model. This representation combines text elements found in the payload (such as timestamps and status indicators), structural information about data types and organization, and numeric summaries including value counts and ranges. The components are sorted for order-invariance and combined using consistent delimiters, creating a stable input format for the transformer model regardless of the original CBOR encoding order.

#### Pre-trained Transformer Model

The approach utilizes the state-of-the-art "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" sentence transformer model, which generates 384-dimensional embeddings from text input. This pre-trained model brings extensive language understanding capabilities, enabling it to recognize semantic relationships between timestamps, status indicators, and structural patterns even when they appear in different orders or formats. The model processes all text representations in batches to generate dense vector embeddings that capture the semantic content of each CBOR payload.

#### Neural Network Classifier

The final component is a PyTorch neural network that processes the concatenated 768-dimensional embeddings (384 dimensions from each payload in the pair). The classifier uses a four-layer architecture with progressively decreasing layer sizes: 512, 256, 128, and finally 1 output neuron. Each layer includes batch normalization for stable training and dropout regularization with decreasing rates (30%, 20%, 10%) as the network narrows. The final layer uses sigmoid activation to output similarity probabilities between 0 and 1.

### Training Strategy

The training strategy uses an intelligent pairing approach that leverages the correspondence between datasets. Positive pairs are created by matching payloads with the same index across the SOSA and modified datasets, assuming these represent semantically equivalent messages. Negative pairs are generated by combining payloads from different indices, but only those with cosine similarity below 0.7 are selected to ensure truly dissimilar examples. This selective negative sampling creates a more challenging and realistic training environment, avoiding trivially easy negative examples that could lead to overconfident predictions.

### Performance Analysis

#### Single Dataset Results

The transformer approach achieved perfect performance on the best single dataset scenario, with 100% F1-score, precision, recall, and specificity, demonstrating flawless similarity detection capability under optimal conditions.

#### Cross-Dataset Validation Results

Testing across all available datasets showed remarkable consistency, with an average F1-score of 98.9%, precision of 99.2%, recall of 98.7%, and specificity of 99.6%. This demonstrates exceptional robustness across different data configurations.

#### High Negative Ratio Results (80% Negatives)

Even under the challenging 80% negative class imbalance that caused previous approaches to fail completely, the transformer maintained excellent performance with F1-scores ranging from 97.7% to 100%, perfect precision, recall between 95.5% and 100%, and perfect specificity.

#### Comprehensive Validation Results

Systematic testing across ten different test scenarios revealed consistently excellent performance. Seven scenarios achieved perfect scores (100% across all metrics), while the remaining three maintained F1-scores above 93.6%. The statistical summary shows outstanding consistency with mean F1-score of 98.9% and low standard deviation of 2.0%, indicating reliable performance regardless of data configuration. Even the worst-performing scenario achieved 93.6% F1-score with 91.7% precision, far exceeding the performance of previous approaches.

#### Strengths
- ‚úÖ **Breakthrough Performance**: 91.8-100% F1-score
- ‚úÖ **Excellent Balance**: High precision AND recall
- ‚úÖ **Outstanding Specificity**: 95.0-100% minimizes false positives
- ‚úÖ **Order Invariant**: Robust to term order changes
- ‚úÖ **Semantic Understanding**: Leverages pre-trained language knowledge
- ‚úÖ **Production Excellence**: Exceeds all deployment criteria

#### Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CBOR Dependency**: Requires successful CBOR decoding
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Complexity**: More complex pipeline than other approaches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Model Size**: Larger memory footprint due to transformer embeddings

## 4. Failed Approaches and Lessons Learned

### Historical Context: The 50% Precision Problem

Before the breakthrough approaches, we systematically explored 32 different neural network architectures (Test 1-32), all suffering from the same fundamental issue: **~50% precision with 0% specificity**.

#### Failed Approach Categories

**1. Raw Byte CNN Approaches (Tests 1-15)**
```python
# Typical failed architecture
class ByteCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(1, 64, kernel_size=5)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv1d(64, 128, kernel_size=3)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv1d(128, 256, kernel_size=3)
        # ... more layers that didn't help
```

**Results Pattern:**
- F1-Score: 52.9-66.7%
- Precision: 41.9-50.0%
- Recall: 97.2-100.0%
- **Specificity: 0.0%** ‚Üê Critical problem

**2. Enhanced CNN with Attention (Tests 16-19)**
```python
# Attention layer that didn't solve the core issue
class AttentionLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(input_dim, num_heads=8)
```

**3. Siamese Networks (Tests 20-21)**
```python
# Siamese approach for similarity learning
class SiameseNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.feature_extractor = CNN()
        self.distance_metric = nn.CosineSimilarity()
```

**4. Advanced Loss Functions (Tests 22-24)**
- Focal Loss
- Contrastive Loss  
- Triplet Loss
- Threshold Optimization

#### Core Problem Identified

**The fundamental issue**: CNNs on raw CBOR bytes cannot capture semantic similarity patterns. The models learned to predict everything as positive, achieving high recall but zero specificity.

**Key Insight**: The problem wasn't architectural complexity‚Äîit was feature representation. Raw bytes simply don't contain learnable semantic patterns for neural networks.

#### Critical Breakthrough Moment

The transition from Test 24 (F1=58.6%, Precision=41.9%) to Test 25 (F1=82.3%, Precision=69.9%) represented the key insight: **semantic feature engineering** was the solution, not deeper networks.

## 5. Performance Metrics Explained

### Understanding the Metrics

For beginners, here's what each metric means in our CBOR similarity detection context:

#### Precision
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```
**What it means**: Of all the pairs our model said were "similar," what percentage were actually similar?

**Production Impact**: Low precision means many false alarms‚Äîthe system flags non-similar payloads as similar, causing unnecessary processing.

**Example**: 73.1% precision means out of 100 flagged similarities, 73 are real and 27 are false alarms.

#### Recall (Sensitivity)
```
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```
**What it means**: Of all the pairs that were actually similar, what percentage did our model correctly identify?

**Production Impact**: Low recall means missed opportunities‚Äîsimilar payloads aren't detected as related.

**Example**: 84.4% recall means we catch 84 out of 100 actual similarities, missing 16.

#### Specificity
```
Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)
```
**What it means**: Of all the pairs that were actually different, what percentage did our model correctly identify as different?

**Production Impact**: Low specificity means the system can't distinguish different payloads, leading to many false positives.

**Example**: 92.2% specificity means we correctly identify 92 out of 100 truly different pairs.

#### F1-Score
```
F1-Score = 2 √ó (Precision √ó Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```
**What it means**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall‚Äîbalances both metrics.

**Production Impact**: High F1-score indicates the model is both accurate (high precision) and comprehensive (high recall).

**Example**: 78.4% F1-score represents good overall performance balancing precision and recall.

#### Why These Metrics Matter for Production

**For IoT Semantic Matching:**
- **High Precision Required**: False positives waste computational resources and cause incorrect actions
- **High Recall Desired**: Missing semantic relationships reduces system intelligence
- **High Specificity Critical**: System must distinguish between different sensor types, commands, etc.
- **Balanced F1-Score**: Overall system effectiveness measure

**Production Thresholds:**
- Precision > 75%: Acceptable false positive rate
- Recall > 80%: Captures most semantic relationships  
- Specificity > 85%: Reliable negative detection
- F1-Score > 75%: Overall production readiness

## 6. Implementation Framework Summary

### Technology Stack

The three approaches utilized different machine learning frameworks and libraries:

**Neural Network Approach:** Implemented in PyTorch with custom semantic feature engineering. Uses WeightedFocalLoss for class imbalance handling, Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling, and supports ONNX export for IoT deployment. Training involves 15 epochs with early stopping and batch normalization for stable convergence.

**Random Forest Approach:** Built using scikit-learn with comprehensive grid search optimization. Explores multiple hyperparameters including tree count, depth limits, splitting criteria, and class weighting strategies. Uses 3-fold cross-validation with F1-score optimization and saves the best model in pickle format for production use.

**Transformer Approach:** Combines the sentence-transformers library for embedding generation with PyTorch for the final classifier. Uses the pre-trained "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model to create 384-dimensional embeddings, then processes concatenated embeddings through a four-layer neural network. Includes intelligent negative sampling based on cosine similarity thresholds.

### Real Data Processing

The transformer approach processes actual CBOR payloads by first decoding the structure using the cbor2 library. For example, a typical payload containing integer keys and mixed data types gets converted to standardized text representations that capture timestamps, structural organization, and numeric patterns. This approach succeeds because it finds identical timestamps across corresponding messages and recognizes similar structural patterns, achieving high similarity scores through content matching rather than semantic vocabulary analysis.

## 11. Professor's Suggestions and Analysis of Previous Failed Attempts

### Context: The 66.7% F1-Score Plateau

The best CNN-based approach (Test 11) achieved only 66.7% F1-score with ~50% precision, essentially random performance for precision. This section documents systematic attempts to address professor's suggestions and explains why traditional neural network approaches consistently failed.

### Professor's Recommendations Implemented

**Original Feedback (French):**
> "Plusieurs s√©ries de tests. Ces tests ont fait varier d'autres param√®tres : fonction de co√ªt, architectures, nombre et tailles des couches. La meilleure est bas√©e sur des CNN et a un F1 score de 66,7%. Probl√®me : l'accuracy est ~50% -> random. Donc, il faut encore am√©liorer."

**Suggestions:**
1. **Augmenter le nombre de couples non align√©s**: Tester avec au moins 80% de n√©gatifs
2. **Diminuer le dropout**: R√©duire √† 30% 
3. **Mettre en place une couche d'attention**
4. **Utiliser les librairies standards (PyTorch)** avec export ONNX
5. **√âtudier l'architecture Siamese neural network**

### Systematic Implementation and Results

#### 1. Enhanced Negative Sampling (Test 16)
**Implementation**: Increased negatives from 50% to 80%
**Results**: Test 11 baseline achieved 66.0% F1-score with 49.7% precision, but Test 16 with 80% negatives completely failed with 0% on all metrics.
**Outcome**: Complete failure - model couldn't learn with severe class imbalance.

#### 2. Reduced Dropout (Test 17)
**Implementation**: Reduced dropout from 40% to 30% combined with 80% negatives
**Results**: Despite reduced regularization, Test 17 still achieved 0% performance across all metrics.
**Outcome**: Dropout reduction insufficient to overcome class imbalance problems.

#### 3. Attention Mechanism (Test 18)
**Implementation**: Added attention layer after CNN feature extraction with learnable attention weights and context vectors
**Results**: Marginal improvement over baseline but still hit the ~50% precision ceiling.
**Outcome**: Attention helped slightly but didn't solve the fundamental representation problem.

#### 4. PyTorch Implementation (Test 19)
**Implementation**: Migrated to PyTorch with multi-head attention and ONNX export capabilities
**Results**: Successfully maintained baseline performance and achieved ONNX export compatibility.
**Outcome**: Successful framework migration but no precision breakthrough beyond traditional approaches.

#### 5. Siamese Neural Network (Test 20-21)
**Implementation**: True Siamese architecture with shared feature extractors and contrastive loss function
**Results**: Improved precision to approximately 60%, representing progress but still below target.
**Outcome**: Best traditional neural network result but insufficient for production requirements.

### Why These Approaches Failed: Root Cause Analysis

#### The Fundamental Problem
All neural network approaches (Tests 11-24) suffered from the same core issue:
- **Pattern**: High recall (95-100%), low precision (~50%), zero specificity
- **Behavior**: Models predicted everything as positive
- **Cause**: CNNs cannot extract meaningful semantic patterns from raw CBOR bytes

#### Technical Reasons for Failure

**1. Feature Representation Gap**
CNNs were learning from raw binary sequences (hex bytes like 0xA1, 0x01, 0x9F, etc.) but needed structured semantic content like timestamps, status indicators, and structural information. The gap between binary data and meaningful patterns was too large for neural networks to bridge effectively.

**2. Information Loss in Encoding**
- CBOR payloads use integer keys (1, 10, 11, 51) instead of semantic terms
- Semantic meaning encoded away during CBOR serialization
- CNNs operating on meaningless byte sequences

**3. Class Imbalance Sensitivity**
- All approaches failed with 80% negatives
- Even advanced techniques (attention, Siamese) couldn't overcome this
- Models defaulted to majority class prediction

**4. Architecture Limitations**
- Increasing model complexity (more layers, attention) didn't help
- Problem was data representation, not model capacity
- Adding parameters without semantic features just increased overfitting

### The Breakthrough: Why Transformers Succeeded

The transformer approach (Test 25) achieved 91.8% F1-score by solving the fundamental representation problem:

#### Key Insight
Instead of processing raw bytes, decode CBOR structure and extract available content. The transformer approach extracts actual data elements like timestamps and status indicators from decoded CBOR structures, then creates standardized text representations that capture content, structure, and numeric patterns for transformer processing.

#### Success Factors
1. **Structural Decoding**: Leverages CBOR's self-describing format
2. **Content Extraction**: Finds timestamps, status indicators, numeric patterns  
3. **Pre-trained Understanding**: Transformer recognizes temporal and status patterns
4. **Order Invariance**: Sorts extracted content for consistent comparison

### Lessons Learned

**For IoT Semantic Similarity:**
- Raw byte processing insufficient for semantic tasks
- Structural decoding essential for encoded protocols
- Pre-trained models crucial for semantic understanding
- Content patterns more valuable than architectural complexity

**For Neural Network Research:**
- Feature representation trumps model architecture
- Class imbalance requires domain-specific solutions
- Systematic evaluation prevents optimization dead-ends
- Sometimes the solution lies outside traditional approaches
